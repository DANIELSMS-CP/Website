                    <p> Recently, I joined an audit in Cantina (https://lnkd.in/g7mNXZwB). It was a 12-day 
                        long audit contest, which has 287 nSLOC. It was a rather short contract that I 
                        thought that I would've had a chance of at least winning some money. Everyday, I read the 
                        scope of the codebase and try to think of anything that might break the contract functionality. 
                        After around 3 days (or more), I thought of something that seems unbelieveable. Two users can have 
                        the same override address, which can lead to problems, such as reward stealing in overrideReceiver. I did 
                        think about it but I was very unsure, since the hack is quite trivial. After the contest ended, I asked my good 
                        friend neko_nyaa and he said that the bug was that, but I just misjudged it (I got the bug, but the mistake was not on 
                        that aspect). I was feeling sad, but at least I learn some things:

                        <li>Do more contest (obviously)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here is a picture of the function—notice that the overrideAddress[msg.sender] lacks access control:</p>
