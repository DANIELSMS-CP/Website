                    <p>I've been playing Maimai alot to the point where I have reached 14k rating. It's a fun game where you can also make friends and look cool. You can also treat
                    it as an exercise. I feel like people should play this, as it is a very underrated game</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>As shown above, I think I can give some people tips on how to play the game (at least for levels like 12+ until 13):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to lightly tap the buttons</li>
                        <p>Unlike others, I think that the purpose of lightly tapping buttons is just to conserve stamina.
                            Many people say that it keeps the machine stay in good condition but I usually don't care about
                            it (unless you are hitting it too damn loud). It will just break anyway.
                        </p>
                        <li>Play stamina chart often</li>
                        <p>Want to play 6 credits without break? Play Love's Theme of BADASS in one credit and try to play random 14 in the
                            next credit. If you can sustain this, I believe that you can sustain 6 credits without break in your difficulty.
                        </p>
                        <li>Play overlevel (Note that this is only for someone that has enough self-awareness that they will not smash the machine.
                            Once again I do not care about this but people might stop you from playing)</li>
                        <p> Playing 14+ helps you know more about standard techniques used in hard levels, enabling you
                            to sightread easier charts but with similar techniques.
                        </p>
                        <li>Watch Youtube</li>
                        <p>
                            No explanation needed LOL.
                        </p>
                        <li>Play Sugarholic by Suou Patra</li>
                        <p>
                            Best song and a free 13.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I guess that is all for this. Hopefully I can reach 15k and at least Master in Codeforces,
                        then I can proudly say that I have won in life :D.
