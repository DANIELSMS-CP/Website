                    <p>In this short blog, I would like to tell about my journey in competitive programming. I have been coding since late 2020. Ever since then, I had many ups and downs. My max rating in Codeforces is 1624, although I don't know how I can drop to Pupil. I also have Atcoder and Codechef accounts but I rarely use them.</p>
                    
                    <p>My NOI journey was a bit hilarious. I lost due to power outage. I found it quite funny that I was unable to use my own laptop since they provided each of us one. The specs for those things were absolutely terrible. All of them are Intel Celeron and 2 GB of ram(?). I could barely open an online compiler (they don't have vscode installed btw). I lost my chance of getting a medal, quite sad tbh. After that incident, I proceeded to win some. Although, they were not as significant as the NOI.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am hoping that I can improve and get at least 2100 in Codeforces. That would be very epic.</p>
